In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column.  For example, if you try to store a large number in a column defined as an integer, you'll get an error.  Another subtle issue is implicit type conversion, where SQL tries to convert values to different types which can lead to unexpected results.  A more advanced and difficult to debug problem arises when using self-joins with incorrect join conditions, leading to data duplication or incorrect aggregation.
